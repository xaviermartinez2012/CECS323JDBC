The code rules are as follows:
* For all queries involving user input, you must use prepared statements
* 􏰀Prove your results after each query
* 􏰀Validate the data either through the java code or database constraints
* 􏰀Handle any SQLExceptions that are thrown
* Use a NetBeans/Derby database for this project
* 􏰀Make sure you there is enough sample data to properly demonstrate the project
..* 􏰀The data can be fictional but it must be meaningful. I do not want to see Book One, Book Two, etc...
